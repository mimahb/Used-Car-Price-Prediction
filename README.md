# Used-Car-Price-Prediction
This project predicts the price of used cars using machine learning models like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed to remove outliers and scale features for better model performance.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visualization of data insights and correlations.
- Outlier detection and removal using the IQR method.
- Model training using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE and R-squared.
- Feature importance visualization for Random Forest.

## Dataset
The dataset contains details about used cars, such as:
- Car name
- Registration year
- Kilometers driven
- Fuel type
- Ownership status
- Transmission type
- Selling price, etc.

## Results
- **Linear Regression:**
  - RMSE: `X`
  - R-squared: `Y`
- **Random Forest Regressor:**
  - RMSE: `A`
  - R-squared: `B`
